# 6502
An emulator/assembler/disassembler for 6502.

This is an emulator for the 6502 cpu. The 6502 was the star of the 8-bit era and
featured in machines such as the Commodore 64 and the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).

The project contains a working emulator/assembler/disassembler for a 6502 cpu.
The project also contains the first steps of using the cpu emulation to
emulate an NES. The PPU (Picture Processing Unit - aka the graphics chip) is partly
implemented. Sprites needs to be added. No audio chip yet.

The title screen of Donkey Kong appears when using a Donkey Kong rom.

This project is on hiatus - but who knows maybe it will be revived.
